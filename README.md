Spotify Downloader is an application that allows you to easily download spotify playlists and songs through YouTube without the need of Spotify Premium through an easy to use GUI and many customisable settings to get the output that you desire.

> [!CAUTION]
> Note that users are responsible for any potential legal consequenses that comes with downloading music. I do not condone unauthorized downloading of copyrighted material and do not take any responsibility for user actions. I highly encourage you to purchase the songs directly from the artists to support them and their work

> [!NOTE]
> **On Break**<br/>
> I have gone on a bit of a break from this app to work on some other projects. I will come back to it in a month or so (as of v1.10.0) to do a full refactor of the code and a complete UI redesign so it will take some time before the next update releases but it should be out in a few months. I will update here and in the app notices when I am working on the next update :)<br/>
> Any issues that are submitted will still be addressed though with hotfixes if needed

<summary><b> Windows protected your PC popup, Windows Defender false positive </b></summary>

---

Since I am not a known publisher to microsoft and the app is not signed, the "Windows protected your PC" popup will always happen on first open and on some machines Windows defender may block the app from running if you are using the portable version

The only way I would be able to fix this is to sign the app but certificates are very costly and not something I would consider doing

### Closing the "Windows protected your PC" popup

Click:
- More Info
- Run Anyway

The popup should not open again after the first time running the app. It most likely will happen after updating the app though

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ea63731-380e-4d18-b2c7-c2c99fe95cc6" style="width: 40%; height: 40%;">

### Windows Defender detecting the app

This has been fixed and the app has been excluded from windows defender scans, if the app is still getting blocked, updating your malware definitions should fix it:

1. Open command prompt as administrator and change directory to c:\Program Files\Windows Defender
2. Run “MpCmdRun.exe -removedefinitions -dynamicsignatures”
3. Run "MpCmdRun.exe -SignatureUpdate"

</details>

## Usage

> [!WARNING]
> Please note that downloading too many songs in a short time span can lead to YouTube flagging your IP and preventing further downloads (Will not effect your YouTube experience). I have not experienced it personally and have downloaded a few thousand songs within a day on a few occasions when testing but there is a case where someone downloaded 5000 songs in one day which got their IP flagged so if you intend to download a large amount of songs it is safer to spread it out over a few days or limit your download speed in the settings.

### Assigning YouTube Cookies / Spotify API Keys

> [!CAUTION]
> By using your account with Spotify Downloader you risk your account being flagged or at worse banned. If using an account be cautious of the rate and amount of downloads you are doing. Adding an account is only used for downloading age restricted songs and using YouTube Premium higher quality audio so if you dont intend to use those features I advise you do not add your own cookies.

> [!NOTE]
> YouTube Cookies and PO Tokens are valid for a very short time usually being for at least 8 hours. It is recommended that you refresh both each time you use the program.

<details>
<summary><b> Inputting your YouTube Cookies</b></summary>

---

***YouTube Cookies are not required***

**The way of retrieving cookies and PO Tokens will vary from browser to browser but I will put the general steps with some browser specific instructions below. There are also images in each of the dropdowns if needed**

***It is recommended you do the following steps in a private/incognito window so the cookies are not effected by general use***

### Retrieving Your YouTube Cookies

First open [YouTube Music](https://music.youtube.com/) and sign in with the account you wish to use

If you are using premium and want higher quality downloads you will first need to go to your settings and change the Audio Quality to High

<details>
<summary><b> How To Change YT Music Audio Quality</b></summary>
	
> <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f8fa4a8-0f25-4726-993c-1944fe10dd22" style="width: 50%; height: 50%;">

</details>

Now retrieve your netscape formatted cookies from YouTube

There are many ways to do this but I use the extension **Cookie-Editor** ([Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookie-editor/)) ([Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/cookie-editor/hlkenndednhfkekhgcdicdfddnkalmdm)) ([Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/cookieeditor/neaplmfkghagebokkhpjpoebhdledlfi))

<details>
<summary><b> Exporting cookies using Cookie-Editor</b></summary>

Open the extension and export your cookies as netscape

> <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/61ffae4c-cd2d-4c8a-b52b-9c23174e5d8e" style="width: 50%; height: 50%;">

</details>

Now that you have got the cookies in your clipboard, paste them into the downloading settings in the Spotify Downloader
> <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1fe7e9d2-99f6-4579-ac3e-a5efb49b3ad1" style="width: 50%; height: 50%;">

### Retrieving Your PO Token

Getting the PO Token is a bit more complicated but if you are having trouble view the browser specific images below

Open your browsers developer console (Usually F12) and go to the network tab. In the filter section enter "googlevideo.com" to only show results under the googlevideo.com domain

Now navigate to a song and start playing it. You will notice that some results now popup in the network tab. Click on any of them

In the headers tab look for the POST Url and find the argument "pot". Copy everything to the right of the "=" and to the left of the "&" before the next argument

## Roadmap

The next few updates will take a fair amount of work and time so figured I would put this here so you all know what is going on. No time frames because I dont know how long everything will take and im doing this project on the side so I dont have much time to put into it, but hopefully at least v2.0.0 will be out by the end of this year

- **Complete refactor**
   - Doing this because the codebase has become a mess, this will make it much easier to work on and add new features
   - Not going to release it as its own update as there will be no new features, will be released with v2.0.0
- **v2.0.0 Complete UI Overhaul**
   - This has been planned for a fair while now, the current ui was only meant to be temporary
   - The settings menu is also becoming a mess so it needs to be redone
   - Some of the UI could also be reworked to better present things
   - Also I just want to make the app look better
   - Since this update will be the first with the refactor as well, expect more issues then other updates but I will try to find and fix as many as I can before release
- **v2.0.0 - v3.0.0 Feature Reworks**
   - There are a few features that are poorly implemented and could be much better so I for those I want to go through a proper process to implement them
   - From v2.0.0 I will start properly planning out features and I will re-do some that are currently implemented to make them better to use
- **v3.0.0 Linux Support** 
   - This will take a fair while to release since:
   - I have never used linux and need to learn how to release on it properly
   - I am using a few windows specific features so those would need to be changed
   - I would need to change the dependency files to support linux
   - Honestly same real process anyone else would go through but I havent done this before so it will take some time to learn

## FAQ
<details>
<summary><b>Where are songs downloaded from?</b></summary>
Despite what the title implies, songs are actually downloaded from youtube. The program retrieves the data of each song from spotify and uses a combination of the duration, title, artists, album, and views in special cases, to determine which songs on youtube correspond to those on spotify. You can find the algorithm behind this in <a href="https://github.com/search?q=repo%3AWilliamSchack%2FSpotify-Downloader+Song%3A%3ASearchForSong&type=code">Song.cpp under SearchForSong</a>.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How accurate are the downloads?</b></summary>
The downloads are almost always accurate and have only few times has downloaded the incorrect song being usually covers of a song. If the song is not on youtube at all, it will not download the song if there are no extremely similar songs in title, artists, duration, etc. After roughly 500 songs tested over many artists and genres I have only gotten around 5-10 incorrect which were all covers of songs that were not on youtube. You can find the algorithm behind this in <a href="https://github.com/search?q=repo%3AWilliamSchack%2FSpotify-Downloader+Song%3A%3ASearchForSong&type=code">Song.cpp under SearchForSong</a>.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>What can I download from spotify?</b></summary>
You can download a playlist, album, episode, or individual songs. You also cannot download all songs from a given artist but if you need to get around this the only suggestion I have is to compile all of their songs into a playlist and input that into the program but I may have a look into supporting this in the future. If you need any help finding the link for your music, there is a guide <a href="https://github.com/WilliamSchack/Spotify-Downloader?tab=readme-ov-file#usage">Here</a> under Setup > How To Find Your URL.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>What is the quality of the downloaded songs?</b></summary>
The audio quality of each song can be configured in the settings ranging from 33-256kb/s with an mp3 file, and 33-128kb/s for everything else in steps of 32 (excluding 33). The program downloads the highest quality stream from youtube usually being around a 128kb/s m4a file and converts it to the desired quality.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Why are the lossless audio formats lossy?</b></summary>
Each file is downloaded as an M4A format through youtube at approx ~128kb/s. This is then later converted to the codec chosen in the settings. Because of this formats like WAV that are usually lossless will still have the quality of that M4A file and the quality cannot be increased further. Lossless audio formats where only implemented as it may be easier for some people to download it with those formats if they require them rather than converting each file themselves.

<details>
<summary><b>Why would my IP be flagged and how can I fix it?</b></summary>
Downloading too many songs in a short time span can lead to YouTube flagging your IP and prevent further downloads (Will not effect your YouTube experience). I have not experienced it personally and have downloaded a few thousand songs within a day on a few occasions when testing but there is a case where someone downloaded 5000 songs in one day which got their IP flagged so it is only administered on overuse. I have no control over when YouTube flags your IP or have any clue what the threshold is but after it has been done there isn't much I can do. The only suggestion I have is to disable your VPN as its IP may have been previously flagged if you have one enabled or try using one if not. 
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Why have there been months between updates?</b></summary>
When I first created this project I has a lot of free time on my hands and was able to work on it for as long as I wanted, but now I have other responsibilities that are taking up a good chunk of my time and there are other projects that I work on outside of this one so I just do not have the time to work on this constantly. This project is being made out of passion and I do work on it often enough to now release updates hopefully monthly and if not bi-monthly, but do not let that put you off as I enjoy working on this project and no matter the breaks that I have taken, this will continue to be developed. If anything does happen where I am unable to work on the project anymore, I will update the readme to reflect that.
