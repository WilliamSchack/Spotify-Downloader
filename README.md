- Run Anyway

<details>
<summary><b> Reasoning Behind This </b></summary>

This popup generally comes up when windows defender does not know much about a program being installed without a publisher. Since my program is not verified by microsoft, this will show up on first launch for almost everyone.
There is not really anything that I can do about this.

## Usage

> Please note that downloading too many songs in a short time span can lead to YouTube flagging your IP and preventing further downloads (Will not effect your YouTube experience). I have not experienced it personally and have downloaded a few thousand songs within a day on a few occasions when testing but there is a case where someone downloaded 5000 songs in one day which got their IP flagged so if you intend to download a large amount of songs it is safer to spread it out over a few days or limit your download speed in the settings.

## FAQ
<details>
<summary><b>Where are songs downloaded from?</b></summary>
Despite what the title implies, songs are actually downloaded from youtube. The program retrieves the data of each song from spotify and uses a combination of the duration, title, artists, album, and views in special cases, to determine which songs on youtube correspond to those on spotify. You can find the algorithm behind this in <a href="https://github.com/search?q=repo%3AWilliamSchack%2FSpotify-Downloader+Song%3A%3ASearchForSong&type=code">Song.cpp under SearchForSong</a>.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How accurate are the downloads?</b></summary>
The downloads are almost always accurate and have only few times has downloaded the incorrect song being usually covers of a song. If the song is not on youtube at all, it will not download the song if there are no extremely similar songs in title, artists, duration, etc. After roughly 500 songs tested over many artists and genres I have only gotten around 5-10 incorrect which were all covers of songs that were not on youtube. You can find the algorithm behind this in <a href="https://github.com/search?q=repo%3AWilliamSchack%2FSpotify-Downloader+Song%3A%3ASearchForSong&type=code">Song.cpp under SearchForSong</a>.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>What can I download from spotify?</b></summary>
You can download a playlist, album, episode, or individual songs. You also cannot download all songs from a given artist but if you need to get around this the only suggestion I have is to compile all of their songs into a playlist and input that into the program but I may have a look into supporting this in the future. If you need any help finding the link for your music, there is a guide <a href="https://github.com/WilliamSchack/Spotify-Downloader?tab=readme-ov-file#usage">Here</a> under Setup > How To Find Your URL.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>What is the quality of the downloaded songs?</b></summary>
The audio quality of each song can be configured in the settings ranging from 33-256kb/s with an mp3 file, and 33-128kb/s for everything else in steps of 32 (excluding 33). The program downloads the highest quality stream from youtube usually being around a 128kb/s m4a file and converts it to the desired quality.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Why are the lossless audio formats lossy?</b></summary>
Each file is downloaded as an M4A format through youtube at approx ~128kb/s. This is then later converted to the codec chosen in the settings. Because of this formats like WAV that are usually lossless will still have the quality of that M4A file and the quality cannot be increased further. Lossless audio formats where only implemented as it may be easier for some people to download it with those formats if they require them rather than converting each file themselves.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Why would my IP be flagged and how can I fix it?</b></summary>
Downloading too many songs in a short time span can lead to YouTube flagging your IP and prevent further downloads (Will not effect your YouTube experience). I have not experienced it personally and have downloaded a few thousand songs within a day on a few occasions when testing but there is a case where someone downloaded 5000 songs in one day which got their IP flagged so it is only administered on overuse. I have no control over when YouTube flags your IP or have any clue what the threshold is but after it has been done there isn't much I can do. The only suggestion I have is to disable your VPN as its IP may have been previously flagged if you have one enabled or try using one if not. 
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Why have there been months between updates?</b></summary>
When I first created this project I has a lot of free time on my hands and was able to work on it for as long as I wanted, but now I have other responsibilities that are taking up a good chunk of my time and there are other projects that I work on outside of this one so I just do not have the time to work on this constantly. This project is being made out of passion and I do work on it often enough to now release updates hopefully monthly and if not bi-monthly, but do not let that put you off as I enjoy working on this project and no matter the breaks that I have taken, this will continue to be developed. If anything does happen where I am unable to work on the project anymore, I will update the readme to reflect that.
